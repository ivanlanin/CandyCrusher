# CandyCrusher

Simple PHP script to cheat/hack CandyCrush. Instead of having to enter both
episode and level number -- which most users aren't aware of --, I use user
friendly level number (165, 297, etc). I also add Dreamworld levels.

You can't play game that need to be unlocked (different episodes). That's
different kind of cheating since money is involved :)
